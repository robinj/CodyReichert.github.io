          <h1 id="reading-list---january-2016">Reading List - January 2016</h1>
<p>One of my goals this year is to spend more time reading. Books on business, startups, psychology, history, etc, are all fair game.</p>
<p>Last month, January, I picked up a few new books. Some I really like and others were OK. In no particular order:</p>
<h1 id="completed">Completed</h1>
<h2 id="rework---jason-fried"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745">Rework - Jason Fried</a></h2>
<p>Reading <em>Rework</em> was a breath of fresh air. Brilliantly put together, blunt no-fluff advice, and wittingly accurate illustrations and metaphors made this my #1 book this month.</p>
<p>If you’re new to startups, veteran to startups, interested in the culture, or anywhere in between, then go to your local Amazon and pick this up immediately. You won’t regret it.</p>
<h2 id="zero-to-one---peter-thiel"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455737377&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=zero+to+one">Zero to One - Peter Thiel</a></h2>
<p>Zero to One is filled with interesting insight from one of our startup culture’s very own, Peter Thiel. There’s no denying that Thiel is a smart businessman - so that alone is reason enough to read anything he writes.</p>
<p>This book really made me think about some tough topics like competing with your competition and how major technilogical advances occur. Every chapter of this book got me pumped up to build something world-changing.</p>
<h2 id="the-virgin-way---richard-branson"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Virgin-Way-Its-Worth-Doing/dp/1591847982/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455737278&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+virgin+way">The Virgin Way - Richard Branson</a></h2>
<p>I didn’t have many expectations going into this book - but I came out with nothing but praise for Sir Branson and The Virgin Way. The book is funny, thought-provoking, and riddled with real life anecdotes about Virgin and other mega-corps (Netflix, Microsoft, etc).</p>
<p>I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in Richard Branson, or what it’s like running hundreds of businesses. His writing is easy to read and intriguing, it’s hard to put down!</p>
<p>After this one, I’ll be looking to pick up a couple more of Richard Bransons books.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-win-friends-and-influence-peopl---dale-carnegie"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455737210&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=how+to+win+friends">How to Win Friends and Influence Peopl - Dale Carnegie</a></h2>
<p>A classic. Anyone who has read any of Dale Carnegie’s books (then you’ve probably read this one) would tell you that is writing style is one of a kind and hilariously interstesting. How to Win Friends is a must read (and re-read) for anyone in a leadership role.</p>
<p>I’ll keep this one on the shelf and read it again.</p>
<h1 id="in-progress">In Progress</h1>
<h2 id="lincoln-the-unknown---dale-carnegie"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lincoln-Dale-Carnegie/dp/160796550X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455737421&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lincoln+the+unknown">Lincoln the Unknown - Dale Carnegie</a></h2>
<p>I picked Up Lincoln the Unknown after finishing Carnegie’s other book, How to Win Friends. Lincoln the Unknown is an interesting tale of Abraham Lincoln’s life and upbringing.</p>
<p>I haven’t quite finished it, so let’s hope for an update next month.</p>
<h2 id="the-hard-thing-about-hard-things---ben-horowitz"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455737458&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+hard+thing+about+hard+things">The Hard Thing About Hard Things - Ben Horowitz</a></h2>
<p>At this point in time, the most I’ve read of this book is the inside cover. Horowitz’s book is highly recommened across the industry as a guide for managing a startup.</p>
